# Thorough Guide to Conducting A/B Tests

A/B tests are widely regarded in the industry as the gold standard for determining the impact of changes to a website or app on user behavior. Their ability to provide reliable results based on robust statistical calculations has made them a favorite among analysts. However, conducting A/B tests involves following a set of procedures to ensure the analysis is sound.

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on conducting A/B tests, covering the following topics:

1. **Fundamentals of A/B Testing (basics_abtest)**
   - **Determining sample size** using power analysis
   - Statistical methodologies for calculations, including t-tests and chi-square tests
   - Conducting A/B tests without sample size limitations using **Bayesian estimation**

2. **A/B Testing with Interrupted Time Series / ITS (interruptedtimeseries_its)**
   - Conducting A/B tests when dividing traffic into A/B groups is not feasible
   - Incorporating time series components, **SARIMAX**, into the ITS model
   - Bayesian approach using **Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) + ITS**
